Conversation summary (13‑20 Feb):
- Installed PostgreSQL 16.11 + PostGIS, created gis DB/user liev, enabled extensions, locked Postgres to localhost for SSH tunnel use.
- Downloaded trimmed DNIT SNV repository, extracted 2024+ shapefile ZIPs, and imported each period into schema snv.snv_<period> (SRID 4674, GiST indexes). Created view snv.snv_ultima and adjusted grants so liev and QGIS can browse spatial tables.
- Stabilized Windows connectivity: PuTTY tunneling, then WSL/ssh/autossh to keep 15432->localhost:5432 alive, shared filter guidance for QGIS (UL=Passos) and created documentation on copy/paste shortcuts in terminals.
- Set up credentialed GitHub pipeline: generated SSH key, configured repo lievref/claudinor, created save-conversation.sh/run-save.sh/periodic-summary.sh plus cron job and environment helper so every summary is committed and pushed automatically.
- Coordinated multi-model logic: defaulted session to openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini, identified allowed higher-tier models, and agreed to upgrade automatically to gpt-5.2 for complex tasks while keeping mini as base.
- Covered usage tracking, TTS audio sharing, and answered questions about token costs, conversation logging, and how to capture WhatsApp history for archival.
